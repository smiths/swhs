This folder contains the C language implementation of the SWHS software.

This implementation uses the CVODE 2.8.2 solver by Sundials to solve the ODEs in the problem.
It uses the gnuplot 5.0 software to generate the graphs of the results.

The software writes a file containing the output data and a PNG file containing the graphs of the water and PCM temperature and energy over the simulation time.

Software testing and a makefile for running the program are planned to be added later.
