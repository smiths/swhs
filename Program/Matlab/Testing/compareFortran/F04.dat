Notes:
PCM properties for lauric acid:
- melting point = 44.2C
- heat of fusion =211.6 kJ/kg = 2.12E+05 J/kg
- CP-solid = 1.76 kJ/kgK = 1760 J/kgK
- CP-liq=2.27 kJ/kgK = 2270 J/kgK
- density-solid =1007 kg/m3
- density-liquid=862 kg/m3

-Tank volume set to be 200 m3 - same as Mather
-coil based on: pipe outer diam of 12.7 mm and length of 5.9 m
(I assume that basically just the top half of the coil is available for
heat transfer) 

- INCREASING HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENT TO 1000 FOR COIL AND PCM (CHECK LATER WHAT CORRECT VALUES
SHOULD BE) PROBABLY TOO HIGH
